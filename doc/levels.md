Martock: Levels
================================================================================
The world of Martock is divided into vertical levels. Each level has its own
creatures, forms, and materials. All of them should conform to the base
environment, which is North America pre-settlement.

Sky
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The sky will be fairly empty, as would be expected. It has clouds, hawks,
eagles, sparrows and in tall trees, maybe squirrels.

Surface
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dirt, sand, water, and grass compose the surface where appropriate. It will be
formed with hills, mountains, lakes, and forests. Different areas will take on
the appearance of different seasons. Snakes, squirrels, wolves, bears, deer, and
buffalo will inhabit the surface. Buffalo will be mountable.

Soil
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a really boring level filled with soil and clay. In it are some worms
and maybe a mole or two.

Mantle
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The biggest level is the mantle. It's mostly stone, with ores of many kinds,
the frequency of which depends on depth. Caves and lakes are present to explore.
Bats and big spiders can make spelunking dangerous.

Core
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deep below all of the other levels is the core. It's mostly a sea of lava, with
some isles of hard stone. Rare ores can be found here, but also some formidable
creatures.
