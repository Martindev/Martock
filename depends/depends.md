Martock: Dependencies
================================================================================
Martock depends on two libraries and a few programs to run. Scripts are
provided for systems with apt and OSX. On Windows these will have to be
installed manually.

Please read the scripts before executing them to make sure you are comfortable
with all the changes they will make to your system.

Run them in this order.

1. sh uni.sh
2. sh allegro.sh
3. sh enet.sh

They are separate scripts so that you can check the results of each script, and
only install the ones you need.
